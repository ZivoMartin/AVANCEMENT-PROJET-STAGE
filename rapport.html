    <h1>The recorder/replayer API</h1>
    <p>A recorder/replayer is an API that first records a sequence of actions performed when interacting with the browser, 
        then convert this sequence of actions into an API-specific script. Once executed, the script will call the replayer, who will read the script and execute 
        the actions 
        one by one on the browser. These test APIs enable fast, automatic testing of a web application 
        rather than exhaustively testing all the application's functionalities each time it is modified, all you have to do is run the 
        script, which is very practical.
        However, recorders have their weaknesses. The recorder listens to JavaScript events and then records them. However, some events 
        events are difficult for the recorder to detect, leading to problems during replay. The aim of this report is therefore to compare three APIs, namely 
        Cypress, Selenium and Playwright, and determine the strengths and weaknesses of each API.

        <p>This table compares the management of keyboard and mouse events for each 
            events for each API. It does not deal with sequences of events (scenarios), but rather with single events.

    <p>To carry out the tests, I've decided to use 4 different sites for greater precision, so all 4 must have the necessary functionality 
        to test all the criteria. So we had to find 4 sites that had a drop-down menu, a combo box and a search text field. Most of 
        the other criteria are found on all websites. It's also much more efficient to test on the most popular sites, so I picked the top 4 sites 
        with all the features from the official rankings (https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/) and tested on them. So, the first one is 
        eBay (https://www.ebay.com/), the second id fandom (https://www.fandom.com/), the third is 
        Wikipedia (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal), and the last is cdiscount (https://www.cdiscount.com/), not in the 
        ranking of most popular websites, but still a very popular website in France.</p>
